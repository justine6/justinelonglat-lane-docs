## [v1.0-docs-reference] – 2025-11-05
### 🎯 Reference Build (Stable)
This is the **first official reference build** of **JustineLonglaT-Lane Docs**, marking the completion of the full documentation experience — stable, centered, and brand-aligned.

#### ✨ Highlights
- **Hero section fully centered** — clean and minimal presentation.
- **Brand logo restored and optimized** (`/logo.png`) for clarity and transparency.
- **“Get All Docs” CTA button** enhanced with the JustineLonglaT-Lane **blue → teal gradient**.
- **Tagline** — *Cloud Confidence. Delivered.* — repositioned for better visual balance.
- **Footer** integrated cleanly with foundation and project links.
- **All architecture diagrams** now render correctly:
  - `/diagrams/high-level.svg`
  - `/diagrams/service-flow.svg`
  - `/diagrams/data-pipeline.svg`
- **Favicon** updated and recolored to match the gradient palette (`#0ea5e9` blue).
- **Page alignment refinements** for consistent white-space and visual hierarchy.

#### 🧩 Infrastructure & Build
- Verified asset loading paths after static migration (`/logo.png`, `/diagrams/*.svg`).
- Confirmed Vercel static deployment structure (root-served assets).
- Added `v1.0-docs-reference` Git tag for permanent reference snapshot.
- Repository structure simplified for clarity and maintainability.

#### 🎨 Brand Consistency
- Harmonized gradient between CTA and favicon.
- Typography aligned with JustineLonglaT-Lane’s identity: modern, readable, confident.
- Layout spacing adjusted for symmetrical hero and section flow.

#### 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Static hosting via Vercel requires root-level asset placement (not `public/`).
- Inline HTML comments inside `<img>` tags break rendering — fixed.
- Case sensitivity matters in SVG paths and filenames on Vercel (Linux environment).
- Incremental commits and visual checkpoints speed up debugging and styling.
