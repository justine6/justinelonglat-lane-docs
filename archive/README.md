# Archive (Non-deployable)

This folder contains historical artifacts kept for reference only.
Nothing in `/archive` is deployed.

## Structure
- `snapshots/` — point-in-time copies of old site states (rare)
- `legacy/` — deprecated files (old styles, old layouts, experiments)
- `notes/` — investigation notes, migration logs, checklists

## Rule
If a file is needed by the live site, it must live in `/public`.
